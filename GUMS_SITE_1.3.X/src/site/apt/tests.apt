Stress Test Results 
 
 GUMS 1.3 tests have not been performed yet, but GUMS 1.2 tests can be seen at 
{{{http://home.fnal.gov/~weigand/gums-1.2.0/gums-stress-test-results.html}http://home.fnal.gov/~weigand/gums-1.2.0/gums-stress-test-results.html}}.
One possible degradation of performance could occur with the new banned user functionality since all banned users are checked
before each request to GUMS.  One thing is clear though, that the more banned users there are, the more it will affect performance.
